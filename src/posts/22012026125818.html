<p><strong><a href="https://antonygreen.com.au/the-coalition-split-and-the-re-emergence-of-one-nation/">Interesting post</a> from Antony Green after One Nation overtook The Coalition for the first time in newspoll</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If One Nation is polling 22% in national polls, there are electorates across rural and regional areas where One Nation will be polling above 35%, that is leading on primary votes. The debate about One Nation preferences starts to become irrelevant if the party is topping the poll. We would be back to the 1998 and 2001 Queensland elections when Labor preferences were required to save some of the National Party’s safest seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rise in One Nation support could hurt Labor in some of its own seats, but the record of elections over several decades is that whenever One Nation support surges, it tends to hurt the Coalition. It is too early to make predictions for the next election, but if the trend on this week’s Newspoll continues, Labor could be comfortably re-elected with the biggest change being the Coalition losing seats to One Nation.</p>

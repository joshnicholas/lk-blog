<p>Atlanta Hawks General Manager Onsi Saleh <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/article/inside-onsi-salehs-journey-from-small-town-alberta-to-hawks-gm/">has an incredible story</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saleh was born to Jordanian immigrants in Texas before the family moved to Alberta for better opportunities when he was an infant. They moved first to Lougheed, a village of less than 300 people southeast of Edmonton, then Vermillion, a little further north, running roadside hotels before running another hotel property in west Edmonton during his high school years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He turned to his old pal Google and began studying the biographies of NBA front office staff, looking past those who came up through the coaching ranks or had playing backgrounds and homed in on the fact that there were a fair number of front office staffers who had law degrees. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He decided to enrol in law school, doing one year at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego and then transferred to Tulane University, which he identified as the leading sports law program available, and which also offered a placement program with the San Antonio Spurs. </p>

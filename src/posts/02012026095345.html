<p class="header">Does anyone really tust Meta to "referee authenticity"?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At various points from 2020 to 2025, Mosseri’s commentary, mostly in Instagram videos, has made the following strategic points: We are changing the feed for your benefit; we are an entertainment and shopping platform; we must win teens and compete with TikTok; and, now, AI is destabilizing reality, and we will referee authenticity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His memos track Meta’s corporate arc. The company has moved from the social graph era, when you saw posts from people you knew, to the interest graph era, when you saw what algorithms though you will like. It is now entering a trust graph era, in which platforms arbitrate authenticity. And it is being dragged into this new era.</p>

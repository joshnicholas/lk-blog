The Hearst Tower is a building at the southwest corner of 57th Street and Eighth Avenue, near Columbus Circle, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, U.S. It is the world headquarters of the media conglomerate Hearst Communications, housing many of the firm's publications and communications companies. The Hearst Tower consists of two sections, with a total height of 597 feet (182 m) and 46 stories. The six lowest stories form the original Hearst Magazine Building (also known as the International Magazine Building), designed by Joseph Urban and George B. Post & Sons, and completed in 1928. Above it is the Hearst Tower addition, designed by Norman Foster and finished in 2006. The original structure is clad with stone and contains six pylons with sculptural groups. The tower section has a glass-and-metal façade arranged as a diagrid, or diagonal grid, which doubles as its structural system.

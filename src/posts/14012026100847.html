<p class="header">A software library with No Code</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whenwords provides five functions that convert between timestamps and human-readable strings, like turning a UNIX timestamp into “3 hours ago”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But like I said: the whenwords library contains no code. Instead, whenwords contains specs and tests...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many utility libraries that aim to perform similar functions, but exist as language-specific implementations. Do we need them all? Or do we need one, tightly defined set of rules which we implement on demand, according to the specific conventions of a given language and project? For libraries that are simple utilities (as opposed to complex frameworks), I think the answer might be, “Yes.”</p>

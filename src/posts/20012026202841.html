<p class="header">Only sixty seats in the US House are competitive?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, The <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings">Cook Political Report</a> rates just 18 seats as tossup races — four held by Democrats and 14 by Republicans. But the map is evolving and Cook recently shifted 18 House races in Democrats’ direction, a sign of the party’s momentum and Mr. Trump’s struggles.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the House’s 435 seats, the vast majority, 375, are rated as “solid” for one party or the other — meaning they are essentially noncompetitive. Another two dozen races are seen as likely to favor one party, while 18 are in the more competitive “lean” category.</p>

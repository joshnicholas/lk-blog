<p class="header">Why there are so many equals signs in the Epstein files?</p>
<p><a href="https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2026/02/02/whats-up-with-all-those-equals-signs-anyway/">Apparently</a> it’s something arcane due to mail servers not liking long strings of text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The artefact we see here is from something called “quoted printable”, or as we used to call it when it was introduced: “Quoted unreadable”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…the equals sign is used to say “this should really be one single line, but I’ve broken it in two so that the mail server doesn’t get mad at me”.</p>
</blockquote>

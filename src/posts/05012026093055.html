<p class="header">Time for some log rolling*</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2026/jan/04/helen-wilding-artist-sketching-whole-melbourne-brunswick-street">a story</a> in The Guardian about Helen Wilding and her years-long project to sketch the entirety of Brunswick St in Melbourne. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilding has lived in the area for a couple of decades, regularly taking a tram down Brunswick Street to her job as a librarian. That occupation helps explain some of her approach – there’s incredible attention to detail in her sketches. They include shop signs and people, quick strokes for antennas and individual bricks. Murals that are faded in real life are also faded in the sketches; the colours capture the changing leaves.</p>

<p class="header">Was Bazball as impactful as the narrative suggests?</p>
<p><a href="https://e61.in/what-can-bazball-teach-us-about-policy-evaluation/">This</a> is a really fascinating post from e61 evaluating Bazball through the lens of policy intervention. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pundits largely focused on the increase in England’s batting averages, concluding that Bazball had unlocked England’s hidden batting talent. But controlling for pitch conditions – by looking at the difference between English batting and bowling averages – suggests 41 per cent (2.8 runs) of the uplift in English batting averages in England was attributable to these changing conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second factor that changed was the quality of England’s opponents. The pre Bazball period included tours to Australia and India (shown by the red dots below), the toughest environments for English players. The immediate post period did not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial effect of a policy often partially reflects its novelty and ability to take advantage of factors which cannot change in the short run. When these factors change – when opponents adapt – short run effects can fade.</p>

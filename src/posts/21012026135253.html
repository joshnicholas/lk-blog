<p class="header">"take back the power of social connection"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing I’ve been reminded of recently is that having community is not always convenient. It can be annoying, time consuming, it takes real effort and you’re not always guaranteed a good interaction – but putting yourself out there is the price for belonging and feeling connected. It’s worth the effort, and having a little natter sure beats scrolling on your phone.</p>

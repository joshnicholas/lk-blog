<blockquote>
<p>For several years, ChatGPT users have generated an archive of human candor that has no precedent, in part because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda. Users are interacting with an adaptive, conversational voice to which they have revealed their most private thoughts. People tell chatbots about their medical fears, their relationship problems and their beliefs about God and the afterlife. <em>Advertising built on that archive creates a potential for manipulating users in ways we don’t have the tools to understand, let alone prevent.</em><br>(My emphasis)<br><strong>From a former OpenAi researcher, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/opinion/openai-ads-chatgpt.html">in the New York Times</a></strong></p>

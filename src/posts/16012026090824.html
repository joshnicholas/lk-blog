<p class="header">How AI Destroys Institutions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Civic institutions are the way that complex societies encourage<br>cooperation and stability. They enable human flourishing by fostering<br>collaboration in service of a shared commitment. But their real superpower is<br>how they evolve and adapt within a framework of fixed rules. Through<br>institutions, knowledge gains legitimacy and gets passed down over time.<br>Institutions empower people to take intellectual risks, challenge the status quo, and adapt to changed circumstances. People participating in institutions develop interpersonal bonds, which nourish our need for human connection, broaden our perspectives, and strengthen our shared commitment to the institutional goal... </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...The affordances of AI systems extinguish these institutional features at every<br>turn. They delegitimize knowledge, inhibit cognitive development, short circuit<br>decision-making processes, and isolate humans by displacing or degrading<br>human connection. The result is that deploying AI systems within institutions<br>immediately gives that institution a half-life.</p>
